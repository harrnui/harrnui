# Hi there 👋,
My name is **Harun**, I'm a **self-thaught**. 

### 🌱Philosophy:
  * I like to write code in a minimalistc and well thought through way (most of the time *it is more of me trying* to stick to that rule). That applies to life too.

### ☕Fun I have:
  * Fun, apart from my learning and preping for a SWD job, is in family time, long walks with my dog and listening to music! Oh yes, and coffee!

### 🏗️What I'm working on:
  * Lately I've been working mostly on front-end projects with React and Next. Initally I started with back-end.

### 📫Contact:
  * For any business inquires contact me at: sharun.freelance@gmail.com
